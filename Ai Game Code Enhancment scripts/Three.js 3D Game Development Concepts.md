# Three.js 3D Game Development Concepts

## Core Components of Three.js

### 1. Renderer
- WebGL renderer is the default and most common
- Handles displaying 3D scenes in the browser
- Other renderers available: Canvas, SVG, CSS, DOM
- Key setup: antialias for smooth edges, setClearColor for background

### 2. Scene
- Container where all 3D objects exist
- Everything visible must be added to the scene
- Uses .add() method to include objects

### 3. Camera
- Essential for viewing the 3D world
- PerspectiveCamera is most common (simulates human vision)
- Key parameters:
  - Field of view (70 degrees typical)
  - Aspect ratio (width/height)
  - Position (z-axis for distance from scene)

### 4. Basic Setup Structure
```javascript
const WIDTH = window.innerWidth;
const HEIGHT = window.innerHeight;

// Renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
renderer.setClearColor(0xdddddd, 1);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, WIDTH / HEIGHT);
camera.position.z = 50;
scene.add(camera);
```

### 5. Geometry, Materials, and Meshes
- Geometry: defines the shape/structure
- Material: defines appearance (color, texture, lighting response)
- Mesh: combines geometry + material into renderable object

### 6. Lighting
- Essential for realistic 3D appearance
- Different types: ambient, directional, point, spot lights
- Affects how materials appear

### 7. Animation
- Render loop for continuous updates
- requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Object transformations (rotation, position, scale)

## Key Development Practices
- Modern browser with WebGL support required
- Can use CDN or npm installation
- Coordinate system understanding crucial
- Performance optimization important for games

## JavaScript 3D Game Development Best Practices

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### WebGL Optimization:
1. **Minimize Draw Calls**
   - Use vertex buffer objects (VBOs) and index buffer objects (IBOs)
   - Batch similar objects together
   - Reduce state changes between draw calls

2. **Instancing for Repeated Objects**
   - Use InstancedMesh for multiple copies of same geometry
   - Efficient for towers, enemies, projectiles
   - Reduces memory usage and improves performance

3. **Texture Management**
   - Use texture atlases to combine multiple textures
   - Minimize texture binding changes
   - Implement texture compression when possible

4. **Memory Management**
   - Dispose of unused geometries and materials
   - Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - Monitor memory usage with browser dev tools

#### Animation and Rendering:
1. **Frame Rate Optimization**
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Implement delta time for frame-rate independent movement
   - Consider adaptive quality based on performance

2. **Level of Detail (LOD)**
   - Use simpler models for distant objects
   - Implement frustum culling to avoid rendering off-screen objects
   - Progressive mesh loading for large scenes

3. **Shader Optimization**
   - Keep fragment shaders simple
   - Use vertex shaders for calculations when possible
   - Minimize conditional statements in shaders

#### Asset Management:
1. **Model Loading**
   - Use compressed formats (GLTF/GLB preferred)
   - Implement progressive loading for large assets
   - Cache loaded models for reuse

2. **Audio Integration**
   - Use Web Audio API for 3D positional audio
   - Implement audio pooling for sound effects
   - Compress audio files appropriately

#### Code Organization:
1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate concerns (rendering, game logic, UI)
   - Use ES6 modules for better code organization
   - Implement component-based entity systems

2. **Error Handling**
   - Check WebGL context availability
   - Handle WebGL context loss gracefully
   - Implement fallbacks for unsupported features

3. **Development Tools**
   - Use GPU profiling tools for performance analysis
   - Implement debug modes for development
   - Use code minification for production builds
