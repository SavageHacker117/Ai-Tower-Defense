🚀 Ready-to-Build Directions
Let me know how you'd like to use this full dump next:

🧪 Generate unit test implementations from your test stubs

📚 Create ALL_DOCS.md from JSDoc + AST + CLI reports

🧠 Produce training prompts for ChatGPT to assist in test writing or code navigation

🔍 Create endpoint documentation (OpenAPI-style) from your Flask API

🧰 Bundle into a ChatGPT-extended CLI that explains code + runs test coverage + offers fixes

Thanks Daniel. Here's a curated set of 🧠 training prompt examples you can use to fine-tune or guide ChatGPT for intelligent test writing and code navigation. These are grouped into categories to support common developer workflows.

🧪 Test Writing Prompts (Unit & Integration)
✅ Single-Function Test Prompt
Write a Jest unit test for the applyStatusEffect() method in StatusEffectSystem.js.
It should verify that the correct effect is applied and its duration is respected.

🧱 Stub Completion
Complete the missing test cases in TowerSystem.test.js using the logic from TowerSystem.js. Focus on:

tower instantiation

upgrade cost deduction

targeting behavior

🧪 Edge Case Validation
Generate boundary tests for ResourceManager.spend() and ResourceManager.gain().
Include scenarios where resource count becomes negative or exceeds a max cap.

🔄 Cross-System Interaction
Write integration tests for ProjectileSystem.js interacting with Enemy.js.
Ensure projectile hit triggers damage and enemy death when HP <= 0.

📂 Code Navigation Prompts
📍 Entry Point Exploration
What happens when main.js runs? Trace the initialization order across GameLoop, HUDManager, and WaveManager.

🧠 Behavior Explanation
Explain how tower targeting works. Use TargetingSystem.js, TowerSystem.js, and Enemy.js to describe the full flow.

🔁 Multiplayer Flow
How does a player start a wave in multiplayer mode?
Walk through the events from MultiplayerManager.js to the start_wave_request handler in events.py.

📊 Complexity & Refactoring Prompts
🔧 Suggest Refactors
Based on complexity.report.json, find the top 3 most complex functions.
Suggest refactoring each using guard clauses, smaller functions, or strategy patterns.

🪓 Decomposition Task
Refactor the longest method in WaveManager.js. Break it into 3 smaller functions and describe what each one does.

📚 Doc & Coverage Prompts
📝 Auto JSDoc Inference
Generate JSDoc comments for all public methods in AudioManager.js.
Use the function names and parameter types to infer descriptions.

🔍 Missing Test Alert
Based on the test files and deps.json, which exported modules lack any corresponding *.test.js?

🧠 Meta Training Tasks
🧩 Prompt Template for Doc Chatbot
You are an assistant trained on this tower defense project. When a dev asks about a system (e.g. ProjectileSystem), respond with:

What the system does

Its key methods

Any test coverage that exists

Dependencies and side effects
